# SuperScreecher9000

**Screech at your computer. It listens.**

A local, GPU-accelerated speech-to-text tool that types wherever your cursor is and controls your system by voice. Built for accessibility, privacy, and freedom.

## What It Does

Press a key, speak, release. Your words appear at cursor. Or launch apps, control media, run shell commands—anything you can type or execute. No cloud. No API keys. No subscriptions. Just you and your computer.

```toml
# Example: map voice phrases to shell commands
[commands]
"open browser" = "$BROWSER"
"open terminal" = "kitty"
"screenshot" = "flameshot gui"
"lock screen" = "loginctl lock-session"
```

## Features

- **Cross-platform ready** - Built with portable Rust crates

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sqrew/ss9k/releases).

Just extract and run - models download automatically on first launch.

### Build from Source (Linux)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sqrew/ss9k
cd ss9k
cargo build --release

# Run it - model downloads automatically on first launch
./target/release/ss9k
```

### Windows Installation

Windows requires additional dependencies:

1. **Visual Studio Build Tools** with "Desktop development with C++" workload
   - Download from [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
   - Select "Build Tools for Visual Studio"
   - In the installer, check "Desktop development with C++"

2. **LLVM/Clang** (needed for whisper-rs bindings)
   - `winget install LLVM.LLVM` or download from [LLVM Releases](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases)
   - Make sure to add to PATH during installation

3. **Rust** via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)

4. **Git** from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

Then build from **"x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS"**:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/sqrew/ss9k
cd ss9k
cargo build --release
```

Yeah, it's a lot. Linux is easier. But it works!

## Usage

```bash
# Hold your hotkey (F12 default), speak, release
# Text appears at cursor
```

### Voice Commands

SS9K uses a **leader word** (default: `command`) to distinguish commands from dictation:

- `"command enter"` → presses Enter key
- `"enter"` → types the word "enter"
- `"command punctuation period"` → types `.` (or `"command punk period"`)
- `"command spell alpha at bravo"` → types `a@b`
- `"command emoji fire"` → types 🔥

**Everything goes through the leader word.** Configure it in your config:
```toml
leader = "voice"  # or "computer", "hey", whatever feels natural
```

**Commands** (say "command" + any of these):

| Category       | Commands                                                                             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Navigation** | enter, tab, escape, backspace, space, up, down, left, right, home, end, page up/down |
| **Editing**    | select all, copy, paste, cut, undo, redo, save, find, close tab, new tab             |
| **Media**      | play, pause, next, skip, previous, volume up, volume down, mute                      |
| **Utility**    | help (show commands), config (open config), repeat, repeat [N]                       |

**Punctuation** (say "command punctuation" + any of these, or "command punk"):

| Category        | Options                                                                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic**       | period, comma, question, exclamation, colon, semicolon                               |
| **Quotes**      | quote, single quote, backtick                                                        |
| **Brackets**    | open/close paren, bracket, brace, angle                                              |
| **Symbols**     | plus, minus, equals, asterisk, slash, pipe, at, hash, etc.                           |
| **Programming** | arrow (=>), thin arrow (->), double colon, equals equals, not equals, and and, or or |

**Spell Mode** (say "command spell" + letters/numbers/punctuation):

| Input                                    | Output   |
|------------------------------------------|----------|
| `command spell alpha bravo charlie`      | abc      |
| `command spell capital alpha bravo`      | Ab       |
| `command spell one two three`            | 123      |
| `command spell alpha at bravo dot com`   | a@b.com  |
| `command spell alpha space bravo`        | a b      |
| `command spell alpha underscore bravo`   | a_b      |

Supports: NATO phonetic (alpha-zulu), number words (zero-nine), raw letters, raw digits, space, and punctuation (dot, at, dash, underscore, slash, colon, hash, etc.).
Capital modifiers: `capital`, `cap`, `uppercase`, `upper`.

**Shift Mode** (say "command shift" + direction for text selection):

| Input                              | Effect                        |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `command shift right`              | Select 1 character right      |
| `command shift right times five`   | Select 5 characters right     |
| `command shift word left`          | Select word left              |
| `command shift home`               | Select to start of line       |
| `command shift end`                | Select to end of line         |
| `command shift page down`          | Select a page down            |

Supports: left, right, up, down, word left, word right, home, end, page up, page down, tab, enter.

**Hold/Release** (for gaming, accessibility, or modifier keys):

| Input                              | Effect                        |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `command hold w`                   | Hold W key (run forward)      |
| `command hold shift`               | Hold Shift modifier           |
| `command release w`                | Release W key                 |
| `command release all`              | Release all held keys         |

Supports: all letters (a-z), modifiers (shift, control/ctrl, alt, meta/super/win), arrows (up, down, left, right), and common keys (space, enter, tab, escape, backspace).

**How it works:** Hold mode rapidly presses the key (configurable via `key_repeat_ms`). All held keys press together, so "hold shift" + "hold w" works for sprint+move.

**Tip:** Use hold for games ("command hold w" to run), accessibility, or any situation where you need a key pressed continuously.

**Emoji** (say "command emoji" + name):

| Input                        | Output |
|------------------------------|--------|
| `command emoji smile`        | 😊     |
| `command emoji thumbs up`    | 👍     |
| `command emoji fire`         | 🔥     |
| `command emoji blue heart`   | 💙     |
| `command emoji crab`         | 🦀     |
| `command emoji poop`         | 💩     |

80+ emoji available: faces, gestures, hearts (all colors), animals, objects, symbols. Say "command emoji rust" for 🦀.

**Case Modes** (say "command mode" + mode name):

| Mode        | Effect                | Example Output       |
|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| `snake`     | snake_case            | hello_world          |
| `camel`     | camelCase             | helloWorld           |
| `pascal`    | PascalCase            | HelloWorld           |
| `kebab`     | kebab-case            | hello-world          |
| `screaming` | SCREAMING_SNAKE       | HELLO_WORLD          |
| `caps`      | ALL CAPS              | HELLO WORLD          |
| `lower`     | lowercase             | hello world          |
| `math`      | spoken math → symbols | one plus one → 1 + 1 |
| `off`       | normal (default)      | hello world          |

Mode persists until changed. Say "command mode snake", then dictate naturally—all text becomes snake_case. Say "command mode off" to return to normal.

**Tip:** Great for coding—"mode snake" for Python, "mode camel" for JavaScript, "mode pascal" for type names.

**Math Mode** converts spoken math to symbols:

| Input                             | Output    |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| `one plus one`                    | 1 + 1     |
| `five times three`                | 5 * 3     |
| `x greater than y`                | x > y     |
| `open paren a plus b close paren` | ( a + b ) |
| `three point one four`            | 3 . 1 4   |

Supports: numbers 0-20, operators (+, -, *, /, =, %, ^), comparisons (>, <, >=, <=, !=, ==), parentheses/brackets/braces, decimals, and common homophones (to→2, for→4).

**Inserts** (say "command insert" + name):

Define text snippets in your config and insert them by voice:

```toml
[inserts]
email = "you@example.com"
sig = "Best regards,\nYour Name"
header = "// Created: {date}\n// Author: Your Name"
branch = "{shell:git branch --show-current}"
```

| Input                   | Output                                       |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `command insert email`  | you@example.com                              |
| `command insert header` | // Created: 2026-01-17\n// Author: Your Name |
| `command insert branch` | main (or current branch)                     |

**Placeholders:**
- `{date}` → 2026-01-17
- `{time}` → 13:52
- `{datetime}` → 2026-01-17 13:52
- `{timestamp}` → Unix timestamp
- `{iso}` → ISO 8601 format
- `{shell:command}` → output of any shell command
- `\n` → newline, `\t` → tab

The `{shell:...}` placeholder is powerful—pull in git info, environment variables, clipboard contents, API responses, anything shell can do.

**Wrappers** (say "command wrap" + name + text):

Define text wrappers in your config and wrap dictated text:

```toml
[wrappers]
quotes = '"'
parens = "(|)"
fire = "🔥"
div = "<div>|</div>"
bold = "**|**"
```

| Input                             | Output                      |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `command wrap quotes hello world` | "hello world"               |
| `command wrap parens check this`  | (check this)                |
| `command wrap fire awesome`       | 🔥awesome🔥                 |
| `command wrap div content here`   | \<div\>content here\</div\> |

If the wrapper value contains `|`, it splits into left/right. Otherwise, the value is used on both sides.

**Repetition** (add "times N" to any command, or use "repeat"):

| Input                              | Effect                        |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `command backspace times five`     | Delete 5 characters           |
| `command down times ten`           | Move down 10 lines            |
| `command repeat`                   | Repeat last command once      |
| `command repeat three`             | Repeat last command 3 times   |

Works with number words (one-twenty) or digits. Handles common mishearings like "to"→2, "for"→4.

**Mishearing tolerance**: SS9K handles common Whisper transcription errors automatically:
- `caret` → also matches "carrot", "karet"
- `colon` → also matches "colin", "cologne"
- `asterisk` → also matches "asterix", "astrix"
- `tilde` → also matches "tilda", "squiggle"
- And many more built-in.

**Custom commands** (from config) work without a leader word.

**Tip:** Use aliases to shorten the leader: `"cmd" = "command"` → say "cmd enter"

### Configuration

Create `~/.config/ss9k/config.toml`:

```toml
model = "small"              # tiny, base, small, medium, large
language = "en"              # ISO 639-1 code
threads = 4                  # whisper inference threads
device = ""                  # audio device (empty = auto-detect)
hotkey = "F12"               # see supported hotkeys below
hotkey_mode = "hold"         # hold (release to stop) or toggle (press again to stop)
toggle_timeout_secs = 0      # auto-stop after N seconds in toggle mode (0 = no timeout)
leader = "command"           # leader word for commands (or "voice", "computer", etc.)
key_repeat_ms = 50           # key repeat rate for hold mode (ms between presses)
quiet = false                # suppress verbose output (set true once comfortable)

[commands]
"open terminal" = "kitty"
"open browser" = "$BROWSER"  # supports $ENV_VAR expansion
"screenshot" = "flameshot gui"
"workspace one" = "i3-msg 'workspace 1'"  # fuzzy matches "work space 1", "Workspace One", etc.

[aliases]
"taping" = "typing"          # fix consistent misrecognitions
"come and" = "command"       # common Whisper mishearing

[inserts]
email = "you@example.com"
sig = "Best regards,\nYour Name"
header = "// Created: {date}\n// Author: {shell:git config user.name}"
branch = "{shell:git branch --show-current}"

[wrappers]
quotes = '"'
parens = "(|)"
brackets = "[|]"
fire = "🔥"
div = "<div>|</div>"
```

**Supported hotkeys:** F1-F12, ScrollLock, Pause, PrintScreen, Insert, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, Num0-Num9

Config hot-reloads when you save - no restart needed.

## Models

| Model    | Size  | Speed   | Accuracy  | Use Case                      |

| large-v3 | 3GB   | Slowest | Best      | Maximum quality               |

Models auto-download on first launch. Change `model` in config to switch.

## Hardware

**Minimum:**
- Any x86_64 CPU
- 2GB RAM (+ model size)
- Microphone

**Recommended:**
- Modern CPU (last 5 years)
- GPU with Vulkan support
- 8GB RAM
- Decent microphone

**Tested on:**
- Intel i5-6500 + HD Graphics 530 (works, ~15s inference on medium)
- Your machine (probably faster)

## GPU Backends

Build with the appropriate feature:
```bash
cargo build --release --features vulkan  # Intel/AMD (Linux/Windows)
cargo build --release --features cuda    # NVIDIA (requires CUDA toolkit)
cargo build --release --features metal   # macOS
```

## Known Issues

- **Wayland**: Global hotkeys don't work (Wayland security model). Use X11.

**TL;DR:**
- **Want power-user features with low learning curve?** → **SS9K** (you're here)
- **Want maximum power and don't mind learning?** → [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/)
- **Need professional/medical dictation on Windows?** → [Dragon](https://www.nuance.com/dragon.html)
- **Want minimal Linux-only dictation?** → [Voxtype](https://github.com/peteonrails/voxtype) or [Nerd Dictation](https://github.com/ideasman42/nerd-dictation)
- **Want mac dictation with a GUI?** → [Dictara](https://github.com/vitalii-zinchenko/dictara)

SS9K sits in the sweet spot: **Talon-level features without the scripting complexity.** Everything is configured in a simple TOML file, yet you get case modes, math mode, shell integration, custom commands, and more.

## Why?

For people who:
- Have RSI or carpal tunnel
- Have motor disabilities
- Think better out loud
- Want local/private speech-to-text
- Are tired of cloud subscriptions
- Rage-smashed your keyboard into pieces

5GB for a fully offline accessibility tool is nothing. Your voice stays on your machine.
Just remove unused models to save space if it's important.

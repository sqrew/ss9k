* NOW
The one thing we're focused on right now.

- [ ] Test on Windows (dual boot or testers)

* NEXT
After NOW is done.

- [ ] Add audio feedback (beep on record start/stop)
- [ ] Add visual indicator (tray icon?)

* SOON
Quality of life improvements.

(Most items completed - see DONE)

* LATER
Future features, no rush.

- [ ] Modal System (see NOTES for architecture)
  - [ ] Sleep mode (default, ignores speech except wake phrases)
  - [ ] Command mode ("command mode" wake phrase)
  - [ ] Dictate mode ("dictate mode" wake phrase)
  - [ ] Sleep phrases ("sleep", "go to sleep", "stop listening")
- [ ] Voice Activity Detection (Silero VAD)
  - [ ] Always-on listening (optional, can disable)
  - [ ] Wake phrase detection
  - [ ] Works alongside hotkey (both available)
- [ ] Context-aware commands (different commands per app)
- [ ] Streaming transcription (type as you speak) - maybe unnecessary with decent GPU
- [ ] Hardware trigger support (bluetooth button)
- [ ] Wearable mic/button (ESP32/Pi Pico)
- [ ] macOS support (need tester first)
- [ ] Wayland support (v2.0, let Voxtype have it for now)

* DONE
Completed tasks.

- [X] MVP pipeline (hotkey -> audio -> whisper -> type)
- [X] Voice commands (enter, tab, escape, copy, paste, etc.)
- [X] Config file support
- [X] Auto-download models from HuggingFace
- [X] GPU acceleration (Vulkan feature flag)
- [X] CI for Linux
- [X] CI for Windows
- [X] Push to GitHub
- [X] Competitive analysis (Voxtype, Talon, Handy, etc.)
- [X] Hotkey mode: hold vs toggle (with optional timeout)
- [X] Configurable hotkey (F1-F12, ScrollLock, Pause, etc.)
- [X] Async processing queue (no more blocking)
- [X] Media keys (volume, mute, play/pause, next/prev)
- [X] Custom command mapping (TOML config → shell commands)
- [X] $ENV_VAR expansion in custom commands
- [X] THE DIFFERENTIATOR achieved (system control)

* BLOCKED
Waiting on something external.

- [ ] macOS CI (whisper.cpp ARM64 SIMD issues + no way to test)

* NOTES
Random thoughts and reminders.

** The Gap We're Filling
Nobody has: dictation + system commands + cross-platform + single binary

** Competition Quick Reference
| Tool     | What they have      | What they lack         |
|----------+---------------------+------------------------|
| Voxtype  | Pure Rust, Wayland  | No system commands     |
| Talon    | Everything          | Python, steep learning |
| Handy    | Popular (10k stars) | Unstable, no sys cmds  |
| Serenade | Great features      | DEAD since 2022        |

** Remember
- Don't over-scope (Serenade died from this)
- Ship early, iterate
- sqrew can test Windows via dual boot
- macOS needs external tester

** Modal System Architecture

Two interaction paradigms, user chooses:

*** Hotkey Mode (current)
- Hold F12 → speak → release → process
- Simple, explicit, low resource, privacy-friendly
- Always available even when VAD is enabled

*** VAD Mode (future)
- Always listening via Voice Activity Detection
- Sleep mode is default (hears but ignores)
- Wake phrases switch modes:
  - "command mode" → enters command mode
  - "dictate mode" → enters dictate mode
- Sleep phrases return to idle:
  - "sleep", "go to sleep", "stop listening"
- Hands-free, accessibility-focused

*** Config Example
#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[interaction]
hotkey = "F12"
hotkey_mode = "dictate"  # or "command"

[vad]
enabled = true  # false = hotkey only
wake_phrases = ["command mode", "dictate mode"]
sleep_phrases = ["sleep", "go to sleep", "stop listening"]
#+END_SRC

#+DESCRIPTION: Simple task tracking for SuperScreecher9000

* NOW
The one thing we're focused on right now.

- [ ] Test on Windows (dual boot, confirm it actually runs)
- [ ] Push CI workflow update (disable macOS)

* NEXT
After NOW is done.

- [ ] Add system control commands (THE DIFFERENTIATOR)
  - [ ] Volume up/down
  - [ ] Mute toggle
  - [ ] Media play/pause
  - [ ] Media next/prev
  - [ ] Focus window by name ("switch to firefox")
  - [ ] Launch app ("open terminal")

* SOON
Quality of life improvements.

- [ ] Fix async queue (recording blocks while processing)
- [ ] Add audio feedback (beep on record start/stop)
- [ ] Add visual indicator (tray icon?)
- [ ] Configurable hotkey (not just F12)

* LATER
Future features, no rush.

- [ ] Voice Activity Detection (Silero VAD)
- [ ] Context-aware commands (different commands per app)
- [ ] Streaming transcription (type as you speak)
- [ ] Hardware trigger support (bluetooth button)
- [ ] Wearable mic/button (ESP32/Pi Pico)
- [ ] macOS support (need tester first)
- [ ] Wayland support (v2.0, let Voxtype have it for now)

* DONE
Completed tasks.

- [X] MVP pipeline (hotkey -> audio -> whisper -> type)
- [X] Voice commands (enter, tab, escape, copy, paste, etc.)
- [X] Config file support
- [X] Auto-download models from HuggingFace
- [X] GPU acceleration (Vulkan feature flag)
- [X] CI for Linux
- [X] CI for Windows
- [X] Push to GitHub
- [X] Competitive analysis (Voxtype, Talon, Handy, etc.)

* BLOCKED
Waiting on something external.

- [ ] macOS CI (whisper.cpp ARM64 SIMD issues + no way to test)

* NOTES
Random thoughts and reminders.

** The Gap We're Filling
Nobody has: dictation + system commands + cross-platform + single binary

** Competition Quick Reference
| Tool     | What they have      | What they lack         |
|----------+---------------------+------------------------|
| Voxtype  | Pure Rust, Wayland  | No system commands     |
| Talon    | Everything          | Python, steep learning |
| Handy    | Popular (10k stars) | Unstable, no sys cmds  |
| Serenade | Great features      | DEAD since 2022        |

** Remember
- Don't over-scope (Serenade died from this)
- Ship early, iterate
- sqrew can test Windows via dual boot
- macOS needs external tester
